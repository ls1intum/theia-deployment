# ==============================================================================
# Staging Auto-Deployment Workflow
# ==============================================================================
# This workflow automatically deploys to the staging environment whenever
# changes are pushed to the main branch.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Provide continuous deployment of main branch to staging
#   - Enable rapid testing of merged changes before production
#   - Maintain staging environment in sync with main branch
#
# Trigger:
#   Automatically runs on every push to the 'main' branch
#
# Target:
#   - Environment: staging
#   - Cluster: Shared staging/test cluster
#   - Namespace: theia-staging (configured via NAMESPACE environment variable)
#
# Protection:
#   No approval required (set to auto-deploy for fast iteration)
#   Configure approval gates in GitHub Environment settings if needed
#
# Note:
#   This workflow shares the same Kubernetes cluster as test1 but uses
#   a separate namespace for isolation. Production uses a different cluster.
