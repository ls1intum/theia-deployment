# Test3 Manual Deployment Workflow
# ==============================================================================
# This workflow handles manual deployments to the test3 environment with no
# input parameters required - it uses the values file directly from the branch.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Quick manual deployment to test3 for testing and experimentation
#   - Uses values file from current branch without any inputs
#   - Ideal for testing configuration changes before merging
#
# Trigger:
#   Manual only - via "Run workflow" button in GitHub Actions UI
#
# Target:
#   - Environment: test3
#   - Namespace: test3-theia (configured via NAMESPACE environment variable)
#
# Usage:
#   1. Navigate to Actions > Deploy Test3
#   2. Select the branch to deploy from (e.g., LSP-config, main)
#   3. Click "Run workflow"
#   4. Deployment will use the values.yaml from the selected branch
#
# Note:
#   This workflow is designed for rapid iteration - it takes no inputs and
#   deploys whatever configuration is in the values.yaml file on the branch.
